Here is the whole project for scrapping web page elements in url https://www.carbon38.com/shop-all-activewear/tops
The requirement of the project is to extract 11 fields (BREADCRUMBS,IMAGE_URL,BRAND,PRODUCT_NAME,PRICE,SIZE,COLOUR,DESCRIPTION,REVIEW,PRODUCT_ID,SKU) from the given pages,
by the end of the project i have extracted data from each pages, 
but while doing this i have noticed that the Breadcrumbs are seems to be absent in the pages.so i cant extract the data and also the review field is also failed to fetch

other than that the other fields are fetched successfully  and the data is uploaded 


to complete the project i have referred various documentations,tutorials around the internet like https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-scrapy/,
